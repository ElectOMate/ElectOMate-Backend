# Page Number Extraction - Key Findings

## ✅ Test System is Working!

The standalone parser successfully:
- ✅ Downloaded docling AI models (171MB layout model + others)
- ✅ Parsed PDF documents with docling (GOOD confidence)
- ✅ Generated chunks with GPT-4o tokenization
- ✅ Provided extensive debugging with ✅/❌ indicators
- ✅ Showed detailed chunk previews
- ✅ Analyzed provenance in depth

## 🔴 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem
**100% of chunks have NO page numbers** because:

```
❌ Chunk does NOT have 'prov' attribute
```

This message appears for **EVERY SINGLE CHUNK**.

### What This Means

The `HybridChunker` from `docling-core` is **NOT preserving provenance information** from the original document chunks.

When you call:
```python
for chunk in self.chunker.chunk(doc):
    # chunk has NO 'prov' attribute!
```

The chunks returned by `HybridChunker` don't have the `prov` (provenance) attribute that contains page number information.

### Evidence from Logs

```

2025-10-20 12:52:16,204 - INFO - 🎉 CHUNK 0 PROVENANCE ANALYSIS COMPLETE
```

This repeats for all 28 chunks.

### Why This Happens

1. **Docling parses the PDF** and creates a `DoclingDocument` with page information ✅
2. **The document HAS page information** (we saw "Document has 62 pages") ✅  
3. **But `HybridChunker.chunk(doc)`** doesn't preserve the provenance  ❌

The chunker is designed to:
- Split text into token-sized chunks ✅
- Add context/headers ✅
- **But it doesn't copy provenance from the original document elements** ❌

## 💡 Solutions

### Option 1: Extract Page Info BEFORE Chunking
Instead of trying to get page numbers from chunks, extract them from the original document:

```python
# Get page mapping from original document
page_map = {}
for elem in doc.iterate_items():
    if hasattr(elem, 'prov') and elem.prov:
        # Map text positions to pages
        page_map[elem.text] = elem.prov[0].page_no

# Then when chunking:
for chunk in self.chunker.chunk(doc):
    # Look up page in page_map based on chunk text
    page_num = find_page_for_chunk(chunk.text, page_map)
```

### Option 2: Use Document Elements Directly
Don't use `HybridChunker` - instead, chunk the document elements that DO have provenance:

```python
for item in doc.iterate_items():
    if hasattr(item, 'prov') and item.prov:
        page_num = item.prov[0].page_no
        # Chunk this item's text
        chunks = split_text(item.text, max_tokens=2000)
        for chunk_text in chunks:
            yield {"text": chunk_text, "page_number": page_num}
```

### Option 3: Check Chunk Parent/Context
The chunk might have a `parent` or `context` attribute that links back to the original document element:

```python
for chunk in self.chunker.chunk(doc):
    page_num = None
    if hasattr(chunk, 'parent') and hasattr(chunk.parent, 'prov'):
        page_num = chunk.parent.prov[0].page_no
```

## 📊 Test Statistics

From the test run:
- **File**: Die_Linke_L25.pdf (466 KB, 62 pages)
- **Parsing Time**: 110 seconds
- **Confidence**: GOOD
- **Total Chunks**: 28
- **Chunks with pages**: 0 (0.0%)
- **Chunks without pages**: 28 (100.0%)
- **Total tokens**: 25,262
- **Avg tokens/chunk**: 902

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Investigate `HybridChunker` behavior**:
   - Check docling-core documentation
   - See if there's a parameter to preserve provenance
   - Check if there's an alternative chunker

2. **Implement one of the solutions above**

3. **Test with the fixed approach**

4. **Apply to production `DocumentParser`**

## ✅ Summary

The testing framework is working perfectly and has identified the exact problem:

**The `HybridChunker` doesn't preserve provenance information from the original document, so chunks have no `prov` attribute and therefore no page numbers.**

This is a design issue with how chunking is implemented, not a parsing issue. The document IS parsed correctly with page information - it's just lost during chunking.
