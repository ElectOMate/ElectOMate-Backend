# Docker Setup Documentation

## Overview

The Dockerfile has been configured with an entrypoint script that:

1. **Validates Environment Variables**: Checks that all required environment variables from `.env` are available
2. **Runs Database Migrations**: Executes `alembic upgrade head` before starting the application
3. **Provides Clear Feedback**: Uses colored output to show the status of each step

## Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be set (from `.env`):

- `WV_URL`: Weaviate database URL
- `WV_API_KEY`: Weaviate API key
- `POSTGRES_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for LLM operations
- `ENV`: Environment (dev/prod)

## Usage

### Development with Docker Compose

```bash
# Make sure your .env file is properly configured
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t electromate-backend .

# Run with environment variables
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 electromate-backend
```

## Entrypoint Behavior

The entrypoint script (`/entrypoint.sh`) will:

1. ðŸš€ Display startup message
2. ðŸ“‹ Check all required environment variables
3. âœ… Confirm all variables are present (or exit with error)
4. ðŸ”„ Run Alembic database migrations
5. âœ… Confirm migrations completed successfully
6. ðŸŽ¯ Start the FastAPI application

If any step fails, the container will exit with a non-zero status code and display clear error messages.

## Security Features

- Runs as non-root user (`app:app`)
- Minimal system dependencies
- Multi-stage build for smaller final image
