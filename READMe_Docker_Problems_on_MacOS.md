Perfect — excellent timing 👏 and I’m really glad your Docker is working again.

Here’s a clean, professional **README.md** you can save locally (for example at `~/DockerFix/README.md`) and follow any time this happens again.
It’s designed to **fully restart Docker Desktop on macOS** without losing your images, containers, or volumes.

# 🐳 Docker Desktop Recovery Guide (macOS)
_Last updated: October 2025_

This guide explains what to do when Docker Desktop on macOS stops responding,
doesn't start from the Applications folder, or `docker` commands do nothing.

The procedure **does NOT delete your images, containers, or volumes.**

---

## ✅ 0. Symptoms

You might need this if:
- `docker ps` or `docker info` shows nothing or hangs.
- Docker Desktop window opens but stays frozen.
- Whale 🐳 icon says “Starting…” forever.
- CLI prints:  
  `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`

---

## 🧩 1. Verify Docker Engine State

Check whether Docker is actually running:

```bash
docker info
````

If you get lots of version/config info → ✅ working.
If you get “Cannot connect to the Docker daemon” → continue below.

---

## 🧱 2. Fully Stop All Docker Processes

Run these commands in **Terminal**:

```bash
sudo pkill -9 -f Docker
sudo pkill -9 -f com.docker
```

Then verify everything is stopped:

```bash
ps aux | grep -i docker
```

You should see **no** lines like `com.docker.backend` or `Docker Desktop Helper`.

---

## 🧹 3. Clear Temporary UI State (Safe)

Delete only cached state — **not** your images:

```bash
sudo rm -f /var/run/docker.sock
rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.docker.docker.savedState
rm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.docker.desktop.plist
```

⚠️ **Do NOT delete:**

```
~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker
```

That folder holds all images, volumes, and settings.

---

## 🚀 4. Restart Docker Desktop

```bash
open -a "Docker Desktop"
```

Wait ~60 seconds until the whale icon 🐳 shows **“Engine running”**
or you can check progress with:

```bash
docker info
```

---

## 🔍 5. Optional Diagnostics (if still broken)

View backend logs:

```bash
log show --predicate 'process == "com.docker.backend"' --last 2m | tail -20
```

If errors repeat, restart your Mac once — your images are safe.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Add a Quick Command for Future Use

Add this line to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):

```bash
alias fixdocker='sudo pkill -9 -f Docker && sudo pkill -9 -f com.docker && sudo rm -f /var/run/docker.sock && open -a "Docker Desktop" && echo "🐳 Restarting Docker Desktop..."'
```

Then next time Docker hangs, just run:

```bash
fixdocker
```

No reboot, no data loss.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* Docker images & containers live in
  `~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/`
* The commands above never touch that directory.
* If Docker Desktop repeatedly fails to start, update it from:
  [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

**Author:** Gabor Hollbeck
**Purpose:** Reliable restart of Docker Desktop on macOS without data loss.

Would you like me to automatically format that into a downloadable `README.md` file so you can keep it locally and run it from your terminal next time (e.g. `cat ~/DockerFix/README.md`)?
